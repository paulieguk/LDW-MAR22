##Scenario

In Lab 3 you will build a class and run labs within that class.  This will allow you to see the Lab Monitoring feature, often shown within the Skillable TMS, accessed via API.  This feature requires two steps for setup.

1. Create a Class
1. Retrieve the Instructor Lab Monitor URL
1. Launch a lab within the Class

### Lets build a Class

Review the parameters for the [**GetOrCreateClass API**](https://docs.skillable.com/lod/lod-api/lod-api-get-or-create-class.md) call as you complete the Postman request.  The GetOrCreateClass API call will returned an existing class if one matches the input paramaters or if no class exists LOD will create a new one.

Before we start with the API command itself you have tpo convert the class times into Unix Epoch format.  The End and Expires times have been done already but you need to calculate the start time. A class start time must be in the future. 

 - [] Open the Unix Epoch time conversion website [https://www.epochconverter.com/](https://www.epochconverter.com/)
 - [] In the wesite enter the date and time information for now + 5 minutes
 - [] Enter the Epoch time here: @lab.TextBox(epochtime)

 - [] In Postman select the GET GetOrCreateClass API command
 - [] Set the parameters for the class using the values below:

| Parameter Name | Value |
| ------ | ------|
| id | +++@lab.LabInstance.Id+++ |
| name | +++@lab.User.FirstName@lab.User.LastName-Class+++ |
| start | +++@lab.Variable(epochtime)+++ |
| end | +++1648771200+++ |
| expires | +++1648771200+++ |

>[!Help] <summary> Epoch time information </summary>

 Epoch time value 1648771200 = 1st April 2022 00:00:00hrs GMT you can confirm this on [https://www.epochconverter.com/](https://www.epochconverter.com/)
 </details>

- [] Enter the API Key details

| KEY | VALUE |
|-----|-------|
|+++api_key+++|+++@lab.Variable(api_key)+++|

- [] Press the Send buttonand wait for the response.  The response will contain details about the class.  Notice the Url field in the response is set to NULL.  Ths shows our API consumer is setup as a new customer not an existing one.  We now need to setup monitoring and also launchs labs within the class.
- [] Save this API command as +++LDW - GetOrCreateClass+++ in the **@lab.Variable(initials)-LDW Collection**

Press **next** to continue
