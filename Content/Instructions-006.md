##Scenario

In Lab 3 you will build a class and run labs within that class.  This will allow you to see the Lab Monitoring feature, often shown within the Skillable TMS, accessed via API.  This feature requires two steps for setup.

1. Create a Class
1. Launch a lab within the Class

Once these steps have been completed the monitoring URL can be retrieved via the ClassAccessURL API command

### Lets build a Class

 - [] In Postman select the GET Class API command
